        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In networking, a physical topology refers
             to the physical layout of devices and how
              they are connected within a network. It 
              describes the arrangement and placement
               of nodes (such as computers, switches,
                and routers) 
            and the cables that connect them.</p>

            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>Physical topology is the physical layout of a network, including the placement
                of devises and the type of cabling used to connect them .it is the
                actual arrangement of the network’s components, such as
                a computers, printers, and servers, As well as the cables
                and other devices that connect them.</p>

                <h3>1. Star topology</h3>
                <img src="1.png" alt="star topology">
                <p>Star topology is a network
                    topology in which all devices
                    are connected to a central
                    device, such as a hub,
                    switch, or router. The central
                    device acts as a mediator
                    for all communication
                    between devices on the
                    network.</p>

                <h3>2. Ring topology</h3>
                <img src="2.png" alt="Ring topology">
                <p>Ring topology is a network
                    topology in which each device
                    is connected to two other
                    devices, forming a closed
                    loop. Data travels around the
                    loop, stopping at each device
                    to see if it is the intended
                    recipient. If it is not, the
                    device passes the data on to
                    the next device in the loop</p>

                <img src="3.png" alt="Bus topology">
                <p>Bus topology is a network topology in which
                    all devices are connected to a single cable,
                    called a backbone. Data travels along the
                    backbone in both directions, and each
                    device on the network receives all data
                    that is transmitted. </p>

                <h3>4. Tree topology</h3>
                <img src="4.png" alt="Tree topology">
                <p>Tree topology is a
                    hierarchical
                    network topology in
                    which nodes are
                    connected in a treelike structure, with
                    one central node
                    (root node) and all
                    other nodes
                    connected to the
                    root node or to
                    other nodes in the
                    hierarchy. </p>
